# Six Second Scribbles

I love this game, but don't want to have physical cards with me all the time. So i asked ChatGPT and Copilot to recreate the same in simple HTML and javascript. 

It did quite well, and after some refining of the cards, i'd say its good enough. 

It took about 30 minutes total dev time. I say dev time, i mean vibe coding time.
